Design:   I used the API that was given in advance.



Implementation Issues:   I had some implementation issues while implementing the random 

player: in order to make a random move, I decided to use three random numbers: the row number, 

the leftmost stick number and the rightmost stick number. Thus I had to assure that those three 

numbers represent a valid move. So first I picked the random row number from the relevant ints 

range, then I picked the random leftmost stick number, and finally I picked the random rightmost 

stick number, and checked that there are no marked sticks in between. 



Answers to Questions:   I implemented the smart player in this way: 

The smart player picks his moves by counting the number of unmarked sticks, 

and marking a stick so that the number of the remaining sticks is odd.

If it is not possible to do so - then the smart player makes a random move.
